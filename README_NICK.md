# Project Overview

I think I spent maybe 3-4 hours messing around with this. I renamed a lot of classes and methods to make them make sense to me and be consistent. I tried to stick to
fairly simple implementations of everything and not over-engineer because I know how it can get trying to decipher peoples' 1500-line takehome responses. Obviously there 
could be more error handling, etc, but that's not what we're here for.

1. **Improve Client Personality Emulation**  
   Done, relatively straightforward. 

2. **Incorporate Context Awareness**  
   Done, also incorporates awareness of the time of day to avoid any "good morning" messages at 11pm, or "let's go wild it's the weekend babyyyyy" on a Tuesday.

3. **Topic Filtering**  
   Done, fairly simple.

4. **Further Product Enhancements**  
   Could have added something vastly more complicated but decided to build something to solve a product problem: fan starts accusing creator of being an AI. In this situation -
   and I'm sure you've thought about it - I imagine it would bomb out of the whole process and surface an alert by email to the creator, or something similar. Maybe!
